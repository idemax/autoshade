/// FORENSIC CONCLUSION, REVISED IN R25 P9 — read the revision, it is the
/// interesting part.
///
/// R24 observed that the reference sidecars carry `crs:Flipped="true"`
/// BESIDE `crs:MaskInverted="false"` on the same component, concluded the
/// two were INDEPENDENT (different concepts, both real), and this test
/// pinned all four combinations importing to distinct flags. The
/// observation was right and is unchanged; the CONCLUSION was wrong, and
/// what falsified it was sample size. R24 saw one cell of a 2×2. The R25
/// census walked the user's whole library — 201 radials — and found
/// `Flipped` and `MaskInverted` PERFECTLY ANTI-CORRELATED: 155 `(true,
/// false)`, 46 `(false, true)`, and ZERO of either matching pair. The two
/// M-B batches agree on the raw bytes and are not in conflict: "the fields
/// are not mirror copies of each other" (R24) and "their values are always
/// opposite" (R25) are both true of the same files. Only the reading
/// "therefore they mean different things" does not survive.
///
/// So Lightroom writes ONE inversion bit TWICE. This engine has TWO flags
/// composed by XOR (`Radial::flipped` in `mask_weight`, `inverted` in the
/// weight loop, render.rs), and importing both halves of Lightroom's
/// redundant pair XORed a value with its own complement: the net came out
/// `true` for EVERY imported Lightroom radial whatever the file said.
/// Measured on `P34` against the real Lightroom export, tone-matched
/// RMS 0.1099 → 0.0751 (blue 0.1901 → 0.0869) once the flip was dropped
/// (E1-verdict §6 defect 2).
///
/// MUTATION THIS CATCHES: putting `crs:Flipped` back into the geometry
/// flag re-inverts every Lightroom radial (rows 1 and 2 below), and
/// writing our own `flipped` straight back out re-emits a pair Lightroom
/// never writes (the last assertion).
