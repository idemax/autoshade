/// Stripping `crs:CameraProfile` out of a Lightroom document because our own
/// recipe carries no name would delete the photographer's profile choice on an
/// ordinary save, which is the very defect the era gate was built to stop,
/// arriving through a different door.
///
/// **The defect this closes** (R25 P8, one root cause with the mask-block arm
/// in [`merge_recipe_into_xmp`]): a `recipe.json` written by v0.30 has no key
/// for any of R25's twenty-seven, so serde fills them from
/// [`EditRecipe::default`] and the recipe "says" texture 0, no grain, no
/// sharpening radius. Owning a key means the merge STRIPS it before writing
/// ours back, and the writer omits a slider at rest — so an ordinary Ctrl+S on
/// such a recipe deleted `crs:Texture="-20"`, the whole Grain block and the
/// PostCrop/SharpenRadius keys out of the photographer's own Lightroom sidecar,
/// silently, with nothing on screen. Measured on the reference library: three
/// of seven files lost nine keys each. "This file has never held that key" is
/// not "the photographer cleared it", and only the era stamp can tell them
/// apart.
///
/// PER KEY, not per recipe, and that is not a softening — it is what keeps the
/// gate from becoming the next silent loss. An era-0 recipe whose Texture the
/// user has just dragged to +20 differs from the untouched default, and that
/// value IS a statement: suppressing it would mean a legacy photo could never
/// write Texture to its sidecar again, permanently, because nothing ever
/// re-stamps the era of a file. So the gate covers only keys still sitting
/// exactly where serde left them.
///
/// PER ERA as well: a recipe is gated only on the eras newer than its own
/// stamp. An era-1 (v1.4) recipe has held every R25 key all along and owns
/// them; it has never seen v1.5.0's parametric curve, and a Lightroom
/// `ParametricDarks` beside it must survive its save exactly as `Texture`
/// survived a v0.30 one.
///
/// The [`WHOLE_BLOCKS`] move as ONE BLOCK each: the writer emits them all or

    // R25 P1 — THE trap of the import unlock. `r.masks.is_empty()` was a
    // usable stand-in for "the user has not touched these" only while a lossy
    // sidecar imported NOTHING. Now that it imports, the develop carries a
    // DEGRADED reading of the base's block (a rotation read as 0, a blend
    // mode ignored, a foreign range left behind), and writing that back over
    // an untouched import would delete the parts we cannot express — silently,
    // on an ordinary Ctrl+S, from the user's own Lightroom file. The question
    // is therefore "did anything move since the import", and it is answered by
    // re-reading the base through the SAME importer the develop came through:
    // equal ⇒ we would only be re-emitting our own approximation, so keep the
    // original bytes; different ⇒ the newest intent is the develop in hand, it
    // publishes, and the note below says so.
    //
    // Ordered so the extra parse is only paid where it decides something: a
    // maskless recipe short-circuits (the old arm, unchanged), and a base with
    // nothing to preserve never reaches the comparison at all.
    //
    // R25 P8 — the SECOND half of that trap, and the reason the predicate
    // moved off `summary.preserve_original` entirely. That flag is set by
    // `MaskSummary::record`, i.e. only when the import was LOSSY, and it was
    // never anything more than a stand-in for "the base has a mask block":
    // while every Lightroom block produced defects the two were the same
    // boolean. P1 made LR blocks import cleanly, and the stand-in came apart —
    // a base whose masks import PERFECTLY, merged with a recipe that has none
    // (a v0.30 `recipe.json` predates mask import; every one of them is
    // maskless), reported preserve_original false, stripped the block and
    // published nothing in its place. Measured on the reference library: four
    // corrections destroyed on one file, eight on another, with an empty note
    // list because the disclosure below was gated on the same flag. So the
    // question is asked directly — DOES THE BASE HAVE A BLOCK — and the
    // answer decides both the preserve and the note.
