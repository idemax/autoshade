// harness's parser: classic-ACR values are flat `crs:Key="value"` attributes,
// verified against the user's real LR sidecars, so plain text scanning
// round-trips everything the writer emits without an XML dependency. Fields
// classic XMP cannot carry (bitmap masks, recolour gains, mask roles) simply
// don't come back — the app-internal recipe.json is the lossless sidecar; this
// reader is the recovery path when only an XMP exists.

/// absolute). Teaching the reader only the new spelling would have re-read
/// every existing era-2 sidecar as era-1 and silently shifted its white
