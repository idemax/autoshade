/// budget. THIS ruler used to keep the scalar, on the argument that it only
/// ever samples INSIDE a feathered transition band "where the correction is
/// a ramp by construction". A desert-dusk pair falsified that argument: a
/// semantic sky raster is the segmentation model's own soft class
/// probability, so in featureless haze its band is the two or three analysis
/// pixels the model happened to emit, and the flat ceiling let the shared
/// shrink park the correction exactly on it — a measured 0.013-0.016 luma
/// step across the 50% contour in the finished 2048-px render (p50 0.018
/// with the mask against 0.005 without, 8-px stand-off, 154 columns), 3-4
/// codes of 255 in a smooth gradient, where the hard family's own ruler
/// would have budgeted one code. Every transition is now charged per
/// crossing against its own context ([`crossing_budget`],
/// [`BOUNDARY_STEP_FLOOR`]), in luma AND per channel, and this constant is
/// the CAP on that exchange, not a promise about bare-sky visibility.
/// No perceptual study is owed for this number, and none is planned: it is a
/// calibrated exchange rate, not a visibility threshold, and the batch that
/// questioned it measured what the rate actually buys — the calibration
/// island's seam fell from +3.15 to +0.92 code values under this budget and
/// is not visible at 1:1. A number re-derived from a fresh threshold study
/// would replace a measurement that exists with a preference that does not. It is its own constant: [`ZONE_BOUNDARY_STEP_MAX`] carries the
/// hard-raster ruler's ceiling, so moving either one can no longer
/// silently re-tune the other. The supervisor's independent RAW rim metric

/// exactly 0.0000, and on the basis the engine actually gates against —
/// the globals-only twin — the correction moved that gate's own p90 DOWN
/// on both pairs (0.00392 -> 0.00230 and 0.00874 -> 0.00857). That ruler

///
/// THIS ruler's half was measured on 2026-09-02, with the segmentation
