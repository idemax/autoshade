    // R33 §F refused to consult `fit_cells` here, on the ground that
    // `fit_zone_dials` solves `color_gains` from this zone's MASK-WEIGHTED
    // MEAN moments while a cell voucher restricted to the same mask reads
    // cell MEANS over the same pixels — one quantity, therefore no
    // independent verdict. That argument is superseded, and it was wrong in
    // one specific way: the voucher reads 96 cells, and since R34 §D1 it also
    // reads the DIRECTION of each cell's move against the direction to its
    // OWN target mean. A zone-wide gain that matches the zone mean while
    // dragging cells whose targets lie elsewhere converges the mean and fails
    // the partition. The estimator's objective is one number; the voucher's
    // measurement is 96 directed ones, so the verdict stops being a
    // tautology: R33 measured 1.000/0.000 for any probe that moved anything
    // at all, while the reference sky reads 0.865 converged / 0.135 diverged
    // / 1.000 ALIGNED — every one of its cells wants the same warm push, and
    // a seventh of its trust-weighted mass still ends further from its own
    // target than it started.
    //
    // This is also the ONE place R33's "Atmosphere passes no cells" is
    // deliberately not followed, and for the reason that doctrine exists. An
    // Atmosphere zone is the CLAIM that this region's content was replaced,
    // and the cells are exactly the instrument that separates a replaced
    // TEXTURE (layout intact — a recolour, recoverable) from a replaced
    // LAYOUT (nothing to recover). Passing no cells here would refuse the
    // question rather than answer it. What does NOT change is the budget:
    // `shrink_atmosphere_gains_in` and `zone_gain` still bound whatever is
    // admitted, because admission is evidence and budget is strength.
    //
    // AND IT IS ASKED ONLY WHERE THE PIXELS CANNOT ANSWER. That is the whole
    // lane's rule, not a second one: a region whose own structural reading is
    // under `DIVERGENCE_GLOBAL` has pixels that ARE each other's counterparts,
    // the pixel-scale refusal about it is a measurement, and a region may not
    // overrule its own pixels. Measured: on the toy zone fixtures (sky D 0.024
    // to 0.101) the cells read 1.000/0.000/1.000 and shipped a colour move
    // twelve pinned refusals exist to refuse — while the sentence printed for
    // it, "because this region's texture was re-synthesised", was false about
    // every one of them. The reference sky reads 0.617 and is the case this
