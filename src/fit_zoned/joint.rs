use super::*;

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// the JOINT VALUE-RANGE family (R23-6, feedback #16)
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A companion reading of "how far apart do these two renders look",
// conditioned on luminance and chroma rather than duplicating
// `fit::look_err`. Production callers multiply its buckets by the same
// per-pixel evidence weights as the objective. Built on THIS module's
// machinery rather than beside it:
// a bucket is just another weight vector for [`zone_moments`] (whose doc has
// always said "a decoded segmentation mask, or anything else"), and the
// mismatch is [`zone_err`]. No second partition mechanism, no second set of
// moment definitions, no second thing to keep in step.
//
// WHAT IT IS, stated precisely because the naming is load-bearing: a joint
// value-range bucket holds every pixel whose LUMINANCE falls in one band AND
// whose CHROMA falls on one side of the near-neutral line. Those pixels are
// scattered across the WHOLE frame. This is NOT a spatial region and must
// never be reported as one ("worst region" would answer a question it did
// not ask); the user-facing wording is "joint distribution check". The
// spatial question is answered by the sky/land zones above.
//
// WHY IT IS NEW INFORMATION — the one thing that had to be settled before
// writing a line of it, because a reading that merely re-derives look_err is
// worth nothing. look_err's tonal term is 21 weighted luma quantiles, so a plain
// luminance-band comparison IS a coarser copy of it. But its colour term is
// three brightness-unconditional channel means, and its hue term buckets by HUE with
// every pixel under 0.06 chroma skipped outright (`fit::band_stats`) —
// neither is conditioned on brightness. "The colour balance of the
// near-neutral pixels in the shadows" and "the chroma of the coloured pixels
// in the highlights" are therefore quantities no term of look_err computes,
// and they are exactly where a split-tone, a tinted black point or a
// white-balance drift lives. Hence JOINT buckets (luma × chroma), never
// luma-only.
//
// WHAT IT MAY DO — three roles, and the boundary between them was decided by
// measurement, not by taste (the numbers live in
// `fit::tests::joint_family_is_calibrated_on_the_fixture_set`):
//   1. REPORT. Always, when it has an opinion.
//   2. CAP the reported confidence. Only downward: a reading that cannot see
//      must never raise a claim (see [`JOINT_CONFIDENCE_SLOPE`]).
//   3. ONE additional bounded-drift veto, in the shape
//      [`ZONE_GLOBAL_REGRESSION_TOL`] already has and fail-open like
//      `fit::neutral_gate_misprediction` — but at the PIPELINE END only
//      (final render vs the untouched base), never inside a stage. Tried
//      inside the cast stage first and measured: the bucket that a change
//      fixes loses its members to a neighbour, so the per-stage comparison
//      inverts, rejecting the one correct cast in the fixture set and
//      admitting both wrecks (the numbers are on [`JointReading::worst`]).
// It is never mixed into look_err's weighted sum: R17-R19's constants were
// each calibrated against a real failure pair, and re-weighting that sum
// would invalidate all of them at once.

/// Luminance bands. Four, not more: every bucket must still hold enough
/// pixels for a MEAN to be stable, and a real photograph does not spread its

// measured truth"). Six real (RAW, finished JPEG) pairs off the user's own
// library — EXIF-timestamp-confirmed same frame — have since been measured
// through `autoshade match`, and they provided that review. Their table is
// `fit::tests::joint_family_is_calibrated_on_the_fixture_set`'s doc. The
// fixture and real-pair values are retained as regression evidence; they do
// not widen the boundary when a refusal happens to read farther away. The ONE
// pair the user called nonsense (an astro composite: the Milky Way gone, the
// deep blue turned grey) read 0.141 — under the old 0.25 line, so it raised
// no warning and still reported 0.58 confidence.
//
// The separation the fixtures established is unchanged and still holds: a
// fit that REACHES its target lands the weighted reading at 0.001-0.06,
// while the pair whose target is a repaint the global model structurally
// cannot reach lands at 0.58. The real pairs simply showed where inside
// that gap the fixed policy line has to sit.

///
/// 0.10 is the policy FAR line, shared by global and zoned reports. The
/// measured pairs below are regression evidence, not a recipe for moving it:
///   * ABOVE the line, a genuine supported miss must warn: the real astro-composite
///     pair reads 0.141 and MUST warn (it was 0.578 confidence and silent at
///     0.25 — the defect this retune closes), and the unreachable synthetic
///     repaint reads 0.581, 5.8× over.
///   * BELOW it, every fit that reached its target: the five honest real
///     pairs at 0.019/0.024/0.030/0.035/0.054 (worst = 1.85× under) and the
///     three fixtures that land at 0.001/0.004/0.045 (worst = 2.2× under).
///   * A one-sided evidence reading is a refusal, even when it is beyond the
///     line; a supported but unsuccessful reading is a miss and must warn.
///     The fixture readings remain regression evidence, not a numeric ceiling.
///   * WHERE INSIDE THE GAP the line sits is a choice, and this is the
