/// from inventing an interior. Within the 5%-95% run, the sky half is tested
/// against `reference` — this same frame rendered WITHOUT the correction
/// under test — exactly as [`boundary_line_steps`] already tests its own
/// crossings, so scene content under the feather cannot false-positive.
///
/// The reference is TRANSPORTED through the settled sky's own linear
/// multiplier before it is subtracted:
///
/// ```text
///     M            = linear(median settled sky on `rendered`)
///                  / linear(median settled sky on `reference`)
///     transported(L) = encode(M * linear(L))
///     d(i)         = luma(rendered[i]) - transported(luma(reference[i]))
/// ```
///
/// A plain difference of differences is NOT enough here, and the reason is
/// that every zone dial is MULTIPLICATIVE in linear light: a band pixel
/// carrying a content rim `r` above the settled sky moves MORE in absolute
/// luma than the settled sky does under the same multiplier, so the additive
/// residual keeps a term proportional to `r * (m - 1)` and charges the
/// correction for a bow it did not introduce. Measured on a 12x4 hazy fixture
/// under ONE multiply applied to the WHOLE frame (no seam exists by
/// construction, truth 0.0000): additive reads -0.0083 / +0.0069 / +0.0110 /
/// +0.0201 at g = 0.70 / 1.30 / 1.50 / 2.00, i.e. 1.68x the budget at a +1 EV
/// dial; the transported form reads exactly +0.0000 in every cell.
/// `transported` is exact because it asks "what would this pixel look like if
/// it had received the settled sky's OWN treatment", so the pixel's own
/// content cancels identically whatever the transfer function does.
///
/// The `M == 1.0` short circuit is load bearing rather than decoration: the
/// sRGB round trip is accurate to 8.9e-08 but not bit exact, and only bit
/// exactness makes `rendered == reference` read 0.0 EXACTLY, which is what
/// keeps the `k=0` verdict an invariant instead of a float coin flip.
///
/// ONE argmax, taken on the difference and ranked by MAGNITUDE — two
/// independent maxima would pair the brightest rendered pixel with a
/// reference pixel somewhere else on the line, which is a comparison of two
/// different places rather than one pixel's own change.
///
/// COLOUR rides the identical form, one transport per channel
/// (`M_c` from the settled sky's own median in that channel), and the
/// transition reports the largest of the three magnitudes together with the
/// channel that produced it, so the charge below is read on that channel's
/// own context.
///
/// Each transition is CHARGED against the same per-crossing budget the
/// cross-boundary-step ruler uses ([`crossing_budget`]), computed on the same
/// three frames: the scene's own luma change across the whole transition band
/// on the reference — the span the introduced bow itself is measured over —
/// or [`BOUNDARY_STEP_SHAPE`] times the correction's own same-side slope read
/// outward from the 50% contour ([`crossing_slope`]), whichever is larger.
/// The contour, not the band edge, is where the slope is read, for the same
/// reason the hard ruler reads it there: a WIDE alpha ramp keeps the probes
/// inside its own ramp and earns credit, a two-pixel one puts them on the
/// settled plateaus where the correction is flat and earns none. That is what
/// makes the feather widening upstream ([`crate::mask_refine::widen_smooth_feather`])

/// Add one scan line's cross-boundary steps to `out`.
///
/// Where [`boundary_line_rims`] reads INSIDE a feathered transition band,
/// this reads ACROSS the mask's 50% contour, so it has something to say about
/// a hard 0/255 raster — the shape `spatial::tile_mask` and the free-mask
/// producer write, whose transition band is empty by construction. That is
/// why the rim ruler returned `rim 0.0` from `0` transitions for every
/// spatial tile ever measured, and why a rectangular seam passed a gate that
/// was reporting a budget it had never been able to test.
///
/// A crossing is a neighbouring pair straddling [`ZONE_BOUNDARY_MID`]. Each
/// contributes ONE difference of DISCONTINUITIES (R40):
///
/// ```text
///     disc(F) = (inside - outside) on F  -  F's own trend over the flanks
///     reading = disc(rendered) - disc(reference)
/// ```
///
/// where the trend is the mean change per 3-px baseline read from each far
/// foot to a flank [`STEP_FLANK_BASELINES`] baselines further out on the
/// same side (a flank the line cannot offer contributes nothing; with
/// neither, the plain step). A gradient, however steep, reads ~0 on every
/// frame; a jump reads its height. `reference` is this same frame rendered
/// WITHOUT the correction under test. A luma step the subject already had
/// at that border — a roof line the mask follows, a horizon a tile edge
/// grazes — appears in both terms and cancels, so scene content cannot
/// false-positive; and because the trend is taken on every frame the same
/// way, the correction's own smooth variation cancels with it, exactly as
/// the plain steps' did. What survives is only the discontinuity the
/// correction introduced, which is the seam itself. The identical reading is
/// taken PER CHANNEL, and the crossing reports the largest of the three
/// magnitudes: a gain set that reproduces a target's mean colour can leave
/// luma601 nearly still while moving one channel several codes across the
/// contour, and a luma-only ruler reads that halo as 0.
///
/// "Inside" is the `>= mid` side, decided by the mask and never by the
/// direction of the scan, so the left and right edges of one brightened tile
/// report the SAME sign instead of cancelling. Both samples must still be on
/// their own side of the contour, which drops a pair straddling a sliver
/// thinner than the stand-off rather than reading a plateau that is not there.
///
/// Each crossing is charged against its own per-crossing budget: the scene's
/// own discontinuity there, `disc(reference)`, clamped between one code and
/// the family's ceiling ([`discontinuity_budget`]). No slope term: `frozen`
/// is still read, but only for the correction's own discontinuity, which the
/// R37 allowance is a share of.
