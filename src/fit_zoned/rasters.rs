/// silhouette, and a box centre lands in the middle of that U — which is
/// ground, not sky. The centre of mass is inside the covered region for any
/// mask this fit will accept.

/// Pixel CENTRES, through the same [`render::MASK_SAMPLE_CENTRE`] the renderer
/// samples with, so the point is in the coordinate system the alpha is read
/// in. `(0.5, 0.5)` for an empty raster: the partition gate upstream already
/// refuses a sky below [`MIN_ZONE_SHARE`], so that is a floor and not a case.
