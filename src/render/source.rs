/// `max_edge` bounds the LONG EDGE of the working buffer, mirroring
/// [`render_to_image`]'s parameter of the same name and obeying the same two
/// rules: the shrink happens BEFORE denoise/tone/geometry (so a
/// preview-resolution caller never pays a full-size develop), and it only ever
/// goes DOWN — `thumbnail` would otherwise UPSCALE a source smaller than the
/// cap, inflating a small image instead of bounding a large one. `None` = the
/// source's own resolution, which is what the export path passes: a delivery
/// render must not be developed at preview size.
///
/// Until this parameter existed the baked arm had no cap at all while the RAW
/// arm had one — the asymmetry the format-support map filed as B2. The
/// resolution-normalised stages (masks, sharpen, geometry) are what make the
/// capped result meaningful rather than merely smaller; they are the same
/// shared functions the RAW path calls, so the two arms cap identically.
///
/// `diag` is the caller's diagnostics channel, and it carries WHOSE pixels
/// these are (R28 Batch-5 5c threaded the path for the stamp; R29-1 threads the
/// channel). A caller really holding anonymous pixels says so with
/// [`crate::diag::Subject::PixelOnly`] rather than a `None` whose meaning lived
/// in this comment; `render_to_file`'s baked arm has the path and binds it,
/// which is what puts the baked half of a parallel `batch` on the same footing
/// as the RAW half.
