/// other three (`me3-a-report.md` §0-Q1 and §1 in the R29 materials ledger,
/// generator `scripts-archive/me3-a/a_09_table.py`).
///
/// The three me3 columns are INSERTED, not refitted. The eight B7-2 columns
/// come across bit for bit — max |Δ| = 0.000000 over all 2320 of their entries
/// (`a_09`) — and the insertion lands because BETWEEN columns is where the

/// version read rms(α) 0.0209 (max 0.0799) at f = 15 and 0.0212 (max 0.0490) at
/// f = 35, which is its α = 0.5 contour sitting 14.8 px and 24.9 px outside
/// Lightroom's on the measured frame's major axis (`a_07` §4). f = 65 was
/// already right at rms 0.0004 (0.2 px) and comes along only because the export
/// existed. Held-out over the whole ladder — drop each rung, predict it from
/// its neighbours — the mean rms goes 0.0268 → 0.0140 (`a_07` §2).
///
/// Two conditionings, both small enough to name outright:
///
/// * α is regressed non-increasing in ρ (pool-adjacent-violators, weighted by
///   bin count) and clamped to [0, 1]. Cost ≤ 0.0073 anywhere (≤ 0.0061 on the
///   eight B7-2 columns, 0.0073 / 0.0072 / 0.0060 on the inserted f = 15/35/65,
///   `a_09`), rms ≤ 0.0009 — the raw wiggle is 8-bit quantisation, 1 DN ≈ 0.004
///   in α.
/// * α is forced non-increasing in f for ρ ≤ 1 (running minimum across the
///   columns). Cost ≤ 0.000061, on 17 entries — all of them in the eight
///   columns that carried over unchanged; `a_09` reports the running-minimum
///   cost on the inserted f = 15/35 as 0.000000 and does not print it
///   separately for f = 65. OUTSIDE the ellipse the order genuinely reverses —
///   more feather reaches further — so the running minimum stops at ρ = 1, and
///   the f = 50 tail really is fatter than f = 75's and f = 100's out there
///   (B7 §3.1, independently reproduced in the raw DN profile).
///
/// `α(0) = 1` at every feather is measured, not fitted or normalised in: mask
/// centres are pixel-identical to the feather-0 frame on all eight rungs B7-2
/// measured (§3.4), and the me3 rungs land on the same near-centre rows. That is the fact that killed the free-endpoint refit, which wanted
/// `d_in = −0.228` and a 6 %-wrong centre at f = 100. Rows inside ρ = 0.0425
/// hold that 1 outright — those bins carry too few pixels to measure and the
/// disc they cover is 0.18 % of the ellipse.
///
/// # Feather 0 is ANALYTIC, not measured
///
/// The measured f = 0 column has a transition 0.0084 wide in ρ, but that is the
/// JPEG-plus-capture-sharpening blur floor (8.7 px on this frame's major axis),
/// not Lightroom's edge — at Feather 0 Lightroom draws a hard edge. So f = 0 is
/// a hard step here, exactly, with `d == 1.0` counting as OUTSIDE: the
/// behaviour the old degenerate-`ramp` guard produced and the one
/// `radial_feather_zero_stays_finite_on_the_boundary` pins.
///
/// # Interpolation
///
/// Linear in ρ between rows, linear in f between columns. Exact on all eleven
/// columns, and a convex combination throughout — so α stays inside [0, 1] and
/// stays monotone on both axes by construction, not by assertion.
///
/// Linear in f is the abscissa the DATA picks, not a default. The measured
/// transition width `W(f) = ρ(α=.05) − ρ(α=.95)` (B7-2 §3.2) spreads only 1.97×
/// as `W/f` across the whole ladder, against 7.5× as `W/√f` and 6.0× as
/// `W/log f`. A held-out check — drop a column, predict it from its neighbours
/// — puts linear-in-f at mean rms 0.027 against 0.018 for the best curved rival
/// (PCHIP in log f), the sign of the difference flipping rung to rung, and
/// log f is undefined at the f = 0 end this function has to reach anyway. A
/// 1.5× edge with mixed sign does not buy curvature that nothing measured.
///
/// me3 then settled it on rungs nothing had fitted, f = 15/35/65 (`a_08`):
/// linear-in-f scores mean rms 0.0141 there, PCHIP-in-log-f 0.0092, cubic in
/// log f 0.0093, Akima 0.0105, plain PCHIP 0.0113 — and INSERTING those three
/// measured columns scores 0.0000. Changing the family buys at most 1.5×;
/// carrying the measurement buys the whole residual, so the family stays and
/// the columns land.
///
/// The residual is what it is, and this is it: ON a column the table is within 0.0009 of
/// the measurement; BETWEEN two columns it is still unmeasured. The two widest
/// gaps of the eight-column version were probed and closed rather than
/// estimated (f = 15 and f = 35, above), which leaves the f ≤ 10 end as the
/// coarsest remaining seam — dropping f = 5 and predicting it from f = 1/10
/// costs rms 0.0253 (`a_07` §2). That seam stays open by decision: no export sits inside
/// that gap, and its transition is narrow enough (W ≤ 0.17 in ρ) that the same
/// α error is a far smaller contour displacement than at f = 15/35
/// (`me3-a-report.md` §4).
///
/// # Carried as measurement, not as a formula
///
/// * `d_out` deliberately does NOT land as a constant — it is baked into the
///   column tails, so the value below costs zero pixels either way. It is
///   **√2**, and me3 excluded `1.43` and B7's `1.4335` outright (`me3-a-report`
///   §0-Q2). Four SHAPE-FREE instruments agree: the sector-block correction
///   endpoint reads 1.41480 ± 0.00046 on the major axis across all eleven rungs
///   (`a_19`); a sign census puts the excess darkening below 2σ from ρ = 1.4160
///   and pure dither (exactly 0.500) over [1.418, 1.424) (`a_18`); the strict
///   all-darkened block bound is 1.41367 (`a_16`); and the last ring-mean band
///   significantly darker than nomask ends at 1.4142 (`a_10`). Forward check:
///   √2 predicts sector endpoints 1.4219 major / 1.4335 minor against measured
///   1.4231 / 1.4386, while 1.43 predicts 1.4377 and 1.4335 predicts 1.4412 —
///   both PAST what the pixels show. B7's ±0.002 was measuring JPEG 8×8 block
///   spill rather than mask support (twelve mod-8 alignment tests, p ≤ 1e−23;
///   B7-2 §3.3), and B7-2's own `1.43 ± 0.015` was the honest width of that
///   contaminated estimate. Residual systematic ±0.001, declared rather than
///   polished away.
/// * The f = 1 FAR TAIL is UNRESOLVED (B7-2 §8-2): its darkening is significant
///   out to ρ ≈ 1.25 and indistinguishable from zero past that, decaying too
///   slowly to separate "same support, small amplitude" from "smaller support".
///   The column carries what was measured and rounds to zero where the 8-bit
///   floor did.
/// * ASPECT INVARIANCE is SAMPLED, once: the shipped table scored against a
///   held-out aspect 1.2 export reads rms(α) 0.0009, max |dev| 0.0031, and its
///   α = 0.5 contour lands 0.04 px from the measurement (against 0.0004 on the
///   fitted aspect 2.5) — and the best single radial rescale between the two
///   geometries is k = 1.00076, so no part of the falloff is anchored in pixels
///   (`me3-b-report.md` H1/A1-A2). Scope, kept rather than generalised: ONE
///   extra aspect ratio, at f = 50 only, still centred. Every other rung is
///   still one geometry (aspect 2.5, centred, Angle 0).
/// * Every column carries the same residual measurement blur that makes f = 0's
///   own column 0.0084 wide, so the narrow rungs are marginally softer here
///   than Lightroom's truth. Deconvolving it would be inventing a kernel.
/// * `roundness` still does not enter — a measured no-op at +100 with feather
///   both 0 and 50 (B7-2 §5). See `MaskGeometry::Radial` in `mask_weight`.
