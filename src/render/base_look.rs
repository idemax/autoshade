///
/// Both pictures go through the SAME ≤1024px box-thumbnail, are cut into
/// 64-column block-mean lumas on their own pixel grids ([`block_lumas`], the
/// grid [`corner_residual`] reads), and the two sorted lists of blocks are

/// least `MIN_SPAN` of neutral luma AND number at least `MIN_BLOCKS`, and it
/// is the median block on each side. Knots therefore sit only where the
/// picture HAS mass (a fixed input grid once planted equal-y knots inside
/// empty luma bands — night sky vs street lamps — which the monotone LUT
/// builder flattened into ~30-level plateaus, and latched its top knots to
/// white on frames darker than the grid); the pinned (1,1) endpoint carries
/// the tail.
///
/// Until 2026-09-23 the match was made on PIXELS, with eleven knots at fixed
/// quantiles. Two things in that reading were not tone. (1) The pixel
/// histogram of the camera's rendition carries its sharpening, its noise and
/// its JPEG texture, which a ≤1024 develop of ours has averaged away, so on a
/// night sky — whose whole picture sits in a band 0.13 wide — the camera's
/// spread read as contrast: slopes of 1.3–1.5 across the sky where the same
/// two pictures paired block by block respond at 1.05. (2) Eleven quantiles
/// of a band that narrow land 0.004–0.01 apart, and the rendition is 8-bit,
/// so each knot's camera side is quantised to 1/255 = 0.0039: the slope
/// between neighbours wandered 0.85–1.72 from quantisation alone. Rendered,
/// both put grain back into the sky that the cleaner had taken out — the
/// star standard's front-end lines (`scripts/denoise_star_standard.py`, 1f
/// and 2f) read the final render's fine-noise ratio 0.3315 against the
/// curve-free 0.2992 (the line: ≤ 0.3001) and its tile-to-tile width 0.0310
/// against 0.0150 (≤ 0.0278). A block mean averages the texture out before
/// the match, and knots ≥ 0.06 apart make the 8-bit step at most 6 % of a
/// slope; through the product path the same frame then reads 0.2914 and
/// 0.0137, and the render sits nearer the camera's own rendition at the
/// median block on all seven ILCE-7RM4A frames measured (rms 2.95 vs 2.97 on
/// the star frame, 11.5–45.6 vs 11.9–47.5 on the six daylight frames, whose

/// A block-mean CDF has no notion of place, so the corner question is still
