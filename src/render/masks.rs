use super::*;

/// Apply each local masked adjustment: blend the masked region toward a locally
/// re-adjusted version, weighted by the gradient mask × amount. Mask coords are
/// normalised so this works at any resolution.
///
/// Per mask, in pass order: local **dehaze** → the fused local **WB**
/// (temperature/tint — the same [`wb_gains`] model as the global stage, see
/// [`local_temp_to_kelvin`]) + **tone** (exposure/contrast/highlights/shadows/
/// whites/blacks) + **saturation** + **hue** pass → local **clarity** → local
/// **texture** → local **sharpness** → local **noise reduction**. The last two
/// are the Detail panel's own operators (`render/detail.rs`, v1.5.0) at the
/// mask's amount — signed Sharpness on the recipe's Radius/Detail/Masking,
/// Noise on its Luminance Detail/Contrast — because Lightroom's local sliders
/// have no shaping axes of their own; `film` is the scale those radii are
/// stated in.
///
/// Clarity/dehaze/texture are ENGINE-RENDERED since R22 (they were XMP-only
/// before, so a mask that moved only those three appeared to do nothing in-app
/// — user feedback #15a/#10B; recipes saved before R22 that carry them now
/// re-render with the local effect applied, which the user signed off on).
/// Clarity and texture are unsharp masks at two different radii
/// ([`unsharp_luma_weighted`], weighted by the mask instead of blending against
/// an RGB copy); dehaze reuses the exact global pair
/// [`dehaze_airlight`] + [`dehaze_px`].
///
/// **Pass order vs the global chain** (WB → dehaze → tone → … → clarity →
/// saturation → NR): the local WB/tone/saturation stages are ONE fused
/// single-weight blend, and splitting them apart to interleave the spatial ops
/// would change the output of every existing partial-weight mask (for `0 < w <
/// 1`, one blend of the composed transform ≠ three chained blends). So the two
/// achievable orderings are kept and the residue is documented: dehaze runs
/// BEFORE the fused pass — preserving the two properties the global order
/// exists for (the monotone pinned-white tone LUT cannot blow what dehaze
/// protected, and saturation stays downstream so the user can trim dehaze's
/// chroma restoration) at the cost of local Temp/Tint landing after local
/// dehaze rather than before it; clarity/texture run after the fused pass, so
/// local saturation precedes them (globally clarity precedes saturation).
/// Both residues are second-order: local Temp/Tint is a relative nudge on a
/// frame that was already globally white-balanced before the airlight was
/// estimated, and clarity/texture scale luma while saturation moves chroma.
///
/// **Memory** (full-resolution export, 61 MP → 244 MB per f32 plane): the
/// spatial passes run SEQUENTIALLY and each drops its planes before the next
/// allocates, so the resident increment is ONE pass's peak, never the sum.
/// That peak is three planes (~732 MB): a luma plane beside `blur_plane`'s two
/// chained ones for clarity, and the three `detail.rs` documents for each of
/// its passes — the spatial-pass row of `decode::PIPELINE_BYTES_PER_PIXEL`.
/// The `!= 0.0` gate on each pass means a mask that does not use an op
/// allocates nothing for it.

///
/// # The defect this closes (R29 Batch-3, user ruling 2026-08-20)
///
/// Lightroom stores mask geometry in different frames and, for LINEAR, uses a
/// different transport topology. Brush dabs live PRE-lens-correction. RADIAL
/// points live POST-correction. LINEAR stores two corrected-frame handles, then
/// either evaluates the reconstructed straight gradient in that corrected frame
/// or transports only those handles to the raw frame and reconstructs it there.
/// The `D` adjudication measured the RADIAL frame at pixel level on the 105 mm pair: the
/// PIXELS move +87.5 px at r ≈ 3250 (the `.lcp` model at 2.69 px rms over 30
/// NCC points, tangential rms 1.22 px) while the radial mask itself measures a
/// similarity of 0.99956 — the identity to 0.05 %, and **88.7 px away from the
/// pixel field**.
///
/// This engine evaluates every mask BEFORE its geometry stage (`apply_masks`
/// runs inside `apply_develop`, `apply_lens_geometry` after it) and then
/// resamples the whole frame. Let `T_engine` map an original pixel to the
/// corrected output and `m_lr` map Lightroom's stored parametric geometry to
/// its exported point. The sample adapter therefore has this table:
///
/// * a BRUSH is then already right — Lightroom rasterises it in that same
///   pre-correction frame, so the two agree with nothing applied. Warping a
///   dab here would apply the field twice.
/// * a RADIAL was **wrong by the whole field** — up to 186 px at 24 mm and
///   88 px at 105 mm — because Lightroom does not move it and this engine did.
/// * a LINEAR needs neither RADIAL's pointwise Lightroom inverse nor a
///   pointwise forward warp. With downstream geometry it is sampled only at
///   `lens_ungeom_norm(p)`; without downstream geometry its two handles are
///   mapped once by `lr_mask_unwarp_norm` and one straight raw-frame gradient
///   is rebuilt in the raw pixel metric.
///
/// RADIAL maps each sample point first through the inverse description of where
/// engine geometry will put it, then through the inverse Lightroom mask
/// transport. [`MaskUnwarp::at`] is that exact-once composition. LINEAR uses
/// [`MaskUnwarp::engine_at`] for the first half only, or the handle-only path
/// carried by [`MaskFrame::LinearHandlesToRaw`].
///
/// **Precision disclosure (D2 LINEAR, 2026-08-24): this is not 1 px closed.**
/// Against the three wall contours, the active/corrected arm's stored-line RMS
/// residual is 9.748/7.025/6.336 px; the inactive/raw H2 arm's absolute RMS is
/// 12.449/9.943/4.979 px. A fitted anisotropic aspect term is diagnostic only
/// and is deliberately not implemented here.
///
/// # Why this is a parameter and not derived from the recipe
///
/// Because "does the geometry stage run?" is the CALLER's fact, not the
/// recipe's. Five surfaces compose develop-then-geometry (`render_to_file`'s
/// two arms, the GUI preview, the GUI coverage overlay, the web preview) and
/// all five gate on the same expression — but the GUI's range REFERENCE builds
/// (`canvas.rs`) deliberately develop a recipe that still carries a lens
/// profile and then apply NO geometry, because they exist to sample pixel
/// values, not to be looked at. They state that with
/// [`MaskFrame::without_downstream`], which keeps RADIAL off the engine sampler
/// while still carrying LINEAR's separate handle fact.
///
/// So the invariant is stated as a value: **whoever runs the geometry stage
/// builds this from the same profile and amount it will pass to
