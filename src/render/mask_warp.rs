//! The mask warp: Lightroom's stored mask frame and its export frame, solved from the in-camera knots, and the view / original maps.

use super::*;

// --- the MASK WARP: Lightroom's stored mask frame → Lightroom's export frame -
//
// Everything in this block is about LIGHTROOM's frames, not this engine's. The
// two are not the same and the difference is the whole reason the block needs a
// header rather than a one-line doc.
//
// WHAT WAS MEASURED (R27 Batches 8-10, R29 `D`, and D2 LINEAR through
// 2026-08-24). Lightroom stores geometry by mask type and LINEAR adds a
// topology distinction:
//
//   * BRUSH dabs are stored PRE-lens-correction. Eleven disjoint dabs on the
//     24 mm frame are displaced from their stored coordinates by exactly the
//     lens-profile distortion field: the `.lcp` model with ZERO free parameters
//     scores 4.63 px rms against a 4.19 px tangential noise floor, and the same
//     field read off the camera's own knots scores 5.13 px. On 138 pixel
//     patches of a `LensProfileEnable` 0→1 pair the two score 2.11 / 2.30 px.
//   * RADIAL points are stored POST-correction. On the 105 mm `D` pair the
//     PIXELS move +87.5 px at r ≈ 3250 (the `.lcp` model at 2.69 px rms,
//     30 NCC points, tangential rms 1.22 px) while the radial mask itself
//     measures a similarity of 0.99956 — identity to within 0.05 %, and
//     88.7 px away from the pixel field.
//   * LINEAR stores corrected-frame Zero/Full handles. With correction ON it
//     reconstructs the straight gradient in that corrected frame. With
//     correction OFF it maps only those two handles through D_fwd and rebuilds
//     one straight gradient in the raw pixel metric. Pointwise H1 is rejected:
//     its predicted full-contour sag is 10.8–24.4 px with the wrong sign.
//
// So `m(r)` below is one number per radius: where a stored radius LANDS in
// Lightroom's export. `LensProfile::mask_warp` holds it as knots.
//
// WHAT THIS ENGINE DOES WITH IT — and the part that is NOT the same question.
// This pipeline evaluates every mask in the PRE-lens-correction frame and then
// resamples the whole frame through the geometry stage (`apply_develop` runs
// `apply_masks`; `finish::frame_and_finish` then runs `apply_lens_geometry` on
// the developed buffer, and its doc states the order outright). A mask this
// engine draws is therefore carried by the
// distortion field exactly as the pixels are, without anyone applying `m`:
//
//   | mask kind   | downstream geometry | engine frame operation              |
//   |-------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
//   | brush       | either              | IDENTITY                            |
//   | radial      | active              | m_lr⁻¹ composed with T_engine      |
//   | radial      | inactive            | IDENTITY (stored coordinates)       |
//   | linear      | active              | sample at T_engine(p), no m_lr      |
//   | linear      | inactive            | D_fwd(z), D_fwd(f), rebuild straight|
//   | bitmap / AI | either              | IDENTITY                            |
//
// The brush row is why nothing here is wired into `mask_weight` for a dab:
// applying `m` to a dab centre AND letting the geometry stage move it would
// apply the field twice, putting a 24 mm corner dab ~186 px past where
// Lightroom puts it.
//
// The radial row WAS a live mismatch — every imported radial on a
// profile-corrected photo rendered up to 186 px (24 mm) / 88 px (105 mm) away
// from where Lightroom puts it. `MaskFrame` + `MaskUnwarp` now compose the two
// independent maps exactly once: `T_engine` cancels the downstream engine
// resample at rasterisation time, while `m_lr⁻¹` asks the stored Lightroom
// geometry at the exported point its own model predicts. Omitting either map
// leaves a whole correction field; repeating either double-counts it.
// The LINEAR rows are H2. Their zero-parameter absolute residual remains
// 9.748/7.025/6.336 px RMS for the active/stored line and
// 12.449/9.943/4.979 px for the inactive/transported line. They are topology
// evidence, not 1 px closure; the fitted anisotropic aspect candidate is not
// implemented. The named LINEAR tests pin active placement, all three wall
// handle pairs, and straightness independently of the RADIAL tests below.
//
// THE RADIUS, decided here because there is nowhere better. A brush dab is a
// circle of radius `r` and the map is not conformal, so a warped dab is an
// ELLIPSE: the local Jacobian's tangential eigenvalue is `m(r)` and its radial
// one is `d(r·m)/dr`, and they differ by up to 6.15 % at 24 mm and 7.66 % at
// 105 mm — MORE than the isotropic part a radius scale would fix (3.25 % and
// 4.25 %). No scalar radius can represent that, so no scalar is the right
// answer, and nothing in the measurement set observes a dab RADIUS at all (the
// eleven-dab ladder measures centres). The map below therefore takes POINTS and
// has no radius argument: the exact way to warp a brush mask is to rasterise
// the stroke in its stored frame and resample the resulting PLANE through
// `m` — which is precisely what this engine's geometry stage already does to
// every mask it draws.
