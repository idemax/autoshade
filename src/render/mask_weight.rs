//! Mask coverage: where inside a pixel a mask is sampled, the per-geometry and combined weights, coverage maps and Range Masks.

/// Where inside a pixel a mask is sampled, as a fraction of the pixel's own
/// width — `0.5`, its CENTRE.
///
/// **The whole mask family samples through this one constant** (R29 C2): the
/// frame loops that ask for a weight ([`apply_masks`]' `weight_at`,
/// [`mask_coverage`]'s overlay, `fit_zoned`'s analysis moments), the texel grid
/// [`rasterise_brush_group`] stamps onto, and the texel grid
/// [`sample_gray_norm`] reads back from. Radial, Linear, Brush, Bitmap and
/// AiMask all land on it, because all five reach the frame through those.
///
/// **MEASURED, on two different negatives.** R29 B7 fitted the hard edge
/// (`Feather = 0`) of a Lightroom-exported radial mask on a 6240 × 4160 frame
/// whose sidecar geometry is `Left = 0.333333`, `Right = 0.666667`,
/// `Top = 0.4`, `Bottom = 0.6` — a centre at normalised `(0.5, 0.5)`, i.e.
/// `(3120.0, 2080.0)` in continuous frame units. The fit, in PIXEL-INDEX
/// coordinates, put it at **(3119.46, 2079.50)** (`b7_03`, edge rms 0.24 px);
/// R29 B7-2 re-fitted a SECOND capture — a different body, lens, day and
/// `OriginalDocumentID` (`b7b_18`, D6) — and got **(3119.49, 2079.51)**. An
/// ellipse fitted over pixel INDICES returns `p − 0.5` for a true continuous
/// centre `p`, so both readings say `p = 3119.96 / 3119.99 ≈ 3120` and
/// `2080.00 / 2080.01 ≈ 2080`: Lightroom maps the stored fraction `u` to the
/// continuous position `u·W`, and pixel `i` — whose centre is at `i + 0.5` —
/// therefore carries the mask value of `u = (i + 0.5)/W`.
///
/// **It is also what the rest of this engine already assumed.**
/// [`apply_lens_geometry`] measures every pixel's radius from
/// `cx = (w − 1)/2`, and `x − (w − 1)/2` IS `x + 0.5 − w/2` — the pixel-centre
/// offset. [`MaskUnwarp::at`] takes `(nx − 0.5)·w`, which equals that same
/// offset only under this convention; with `nx = x/w` the mask un-warp sat
/// half a pixel off the resampler it is defined to invert. The two now agree
/// exactly rather than nearly.
///
/// **⚠ RENDER-BEHAVIOUR CHANGE**, the seventh on the v0.35.0 list: every mask
/// of every type now lands half a pixel up and to the left of where this
/// engine used to put it. That is the direction the measurement demands — the
/// old `x/w` gave pixel `x` the value belonging to continuous position `x`,
/// which is its own top-left CORNER — and the size of the correction is
/// exactly 0.5 px on each axis, everywhere, with no dependence on feather,
/// geometry or frame size.
///

            //   was the load-bearing find (the sourced claim said only the inner

            //   Feather 50 (`PROBE3-ADDENDUM.md` §3.1). The LUT keeps that half.

            //   read `0.79 − 0.94 f`, negative at f = 1. Left standing at the
            //   time — a two-branch replacement needed its own adjudication.

            //   smoothstep across a profile that is not one. `d_out` is CONSTANT

            //   knee to fit in the first place.
            // * R29 B7-2 supplied the f = 1/5/10/90 rungs and closed it: the
            //   f ∈ (0, 25) opening is continuous, no closed form reaches the
            //   measurement floor, and the shipped ramp was already RIGHT for
            //   f ≤ 5. That last one is why `radial_falloff` degenerates to an
            //   EXACT hard edge at f = 0 rather than to a table row.
