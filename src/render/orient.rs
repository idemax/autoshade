///   pure rotations the migration was ALREADY exact. Reflections do not:
///   `rot(deg) ∘ M == M ∘ rot(−deg)`. Leaving the angle alone through a
///   MIRROR therefore straightened the frame the wrong way by `2·deg` — the
///   approximation R24 registered — and every crop coordinate then indexed
///   content that had been rotated out from under it.
///
/// The fix is the rule already applied to the ellipse `angle` just below: a

/// **Not migrated, and correctly so: `Radial::midpoint`** (R25 P5). It is a
/// ratio along the ellipse's own falloff axis, not a point in the frame — the

/// meaning exactly what it meant. Said out loud because the next reader will
/// scan this function for "every geometry field" and find one it skips.
///
/// **Not migrated, and correctly so: the four local point curves** (R25 P6,
/// `LocalAdjustment::main_curve` …). Their points are `{input, output}` pairs
/// on the 0..255 TONE axis, not positions in the frame: rotating a photo
/// changes which pixels a mask covers, never what value 128 maps to. Stated
/// here for the same reason as `midpoint` — they are fields on a mask, and a
/// reader auditing "did the migration cover every mask field?" must find the
/// answer rather than a silence.
///
/// **`frame`** is the shape of the rectangle the coordinates are in BEFORE the
/// turn, and only the brush arm reads it ([`CoordFrame`]). `None` means "not
/// known here", and the honest consequence is that a brush's dabs are left
/// where they were — every production caller supplies one when it can.
/// `pipeline::rotate_recipe`, which reads the photo's header lazily, passes
/// `None` exactly when the recipe holds no brush stroke at all
/// ([`recipe_has_brush_strokes`]); the sidecar import (W14) passes it for a
/// document that declares an orientation but no rectangle, beside a
