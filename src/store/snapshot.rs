/// THE develop's render source, shared by every surface (CLI, GUI export and
/// the web) so they can never disagree about what a recipe is applied TO.
///
/// A saved `pixels.json` master IS the develop's source: heal/clone/generative
/// results are pixels no recipe can reproduce. The calibration rule rides
/// along because it is a property of the SOURCE, not of the surface:
/// * `inplace` master (heal/clone) = a NEUTRAL develop, so `base_curve` and
///   `lens_profile` still render on top of it;
/// * `generated` master (AI reimagine/fill) already carries the look in its
///   pixels, so both fields are stripped from the copy being rendered — the
///   recipe ON DISK keeps them (a master that later fails to decode must
///   still restore a calibrated develop).
///
/// A master that WAS recorded but cannot be honoured is an `Err` naming the
/// remedy, not a silent fallback — exporting the un-retouched source while
/// reporting success was the A6 defect. Preview surfaces degrade explicitly
/// at their call site (a canvas must still open; the web rides an
/// X-Preview-Warning); the silently-degrading `render_source` wrapper had no
/// callers left and hid exactly that decision, so it is gone. On success the
/// pre-era repair's disclosure rides along for the caller to surface.
