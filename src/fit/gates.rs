// THE TABLE IS THE 2026-09-02 FRAME and no longer the corpus's. Two fixes of
// 2026-09-21 moved every residual in it — the base look estimated against the
// picture the camera drew, and the develop window moved onto the DefaultCrop
// rectangle — and re-read on the frame those leave, one of the three caps
// binds on all six `p` pairs, `p36` included: the ladder proposes 0.63 there
// and 0.51 is reported. So the corpus as it stands measures this slope on NO
// pair. That is a fact about the corpus, not an argument for a different
// number, and 6.0 is unchanged: the relation this comment derives is the one
// `the_confidence_family_is_one_calibration` pins, and it holds frame by
// frame. The current residuals are in the ledger (Part 13).
