/// vivid gold one is not (≈ 0.37), and an asymmetric gate mapped the sky's
/// luma cluster across a ramp it doesn't belong to, distorting the whole
/// tone solve; or the shares stay COMPARABLE while a luma-CONCENTRATED band
/// churns out of one side's class — P20 × reimagine, 2026-08-12: the
/// target re-hued 24% of the base's neutral class (the pale sky, base-luma
/// q50 ≈ 197/255, → vivid blue), the share ratio read a passing 1.29×, and
/// the base's bright grey ranks paired against target ranks the sky no
/// longer belongs to — every upper-mid darkened and the render shipped
/// murky. Shares are a SIZE proxy, blind to composition (and the haze pair
/// proves one-sided CDF-shift proxies rank harm no better), so the gate is
/// judged by the harm itself: [`neutral_gate_misprediction`] scores the
/// gated evidence map against the shared class's own observable pairing.
/// Either way the assumption is dead: fall back to full-pixel CDFs on BOTH
/// sides (deciding per side, as the original code did, can even compare a
/// neutral-gated CDF against a full one). 1.75× keeps the
/// matched-population regressions (identity / roundtrip / violet canyon
/// ≈ 1.0×) while catching the golden-sky asymmetry (2.0×); the
/// misprediction ceiling is anchored in [`NEUTRAL_MISPREDICTION_MAX`]'s
/// doc. The two detectors are COMPLEMENTARY, not redundant (R18, measured
/// on the archive): the share ratio is alignment-free — it still works
/// when misregistration slides the misprediction metric toward 0 (its
/// fail-open direction) — while the misprediction gate catches membership
/// churn the ratio cannot see (P21 × reimagine-4: share 1.51×,
/// misprediction 0.034 — only this gate fires). A >1.75× share asymmetry
/// falls back UNCONDITIONALLY, by design: a low misprediction reading must
/// never override it, because misregistration fakes exactly that reading
/// (the fail-open direction), and the fallback itself is the safe arm —
/// on the two live pairs whose evidence failed a gate, the fallback solve
/// measured better than the gated one both times. The sentence that stood
/// here — that a benign uniform >1.75× inflation had only ever been seen on
/// a constructed frame, never on a real pair — was half right, and the
/// measurement replaces it. Neutral shares on both sides of every
/// calibration pair (2026-09-02):
///
/// | pair    | source | target | ratio |
/// |---------|--------|--------|-------|
/// | neutral | 0.7203 | 0.3073 | 2.34x |
/// | p36     | 0.3682 | 0.0733 | 5.02x |
/// | p37     | 0.3639 | 0.2884 | 1.26x |
/// | p38     | 0.3498 | 0.1668 | 2.10x |
/// | p39     | 0.7108 | 0.1925 | 3.69x |
/// | p40     | 0.4634 | 0.0184 | 25.13x |
/// | p41     | 0.2870 | 0.0638 | 4.50x |
///
/// So 6 of the 7 corpus pairs are over the line and the
/// unconditional fallback is an everyday arm rather than a contingency —
/// `p36` shows how a SAME-CONTENT pair gets there, its grade lifting chroma
/// until four fifths of the source's neutral class is no longer neutral on
/// the target side. What is still synthetic is the BENIGN case the old sentence
/// meant: two sides differing only by a uniform neutral-share scale over the
/// same composition, which only `a_uniformly_inflated_neutral_class_keeps_the_gate`
/// builds. Every real pair over the line is over it because the two sides
/// really do hold different colour populations, which is the reading the
/// fallback exists to distrust. Gate order: cheap counts and shares first,
/// the misprediction pass (a full-frame scan plus four CDFs) last, so
/// under-evidenced pairs never pay for it.

/// of it). Grids that disagree by more than aspect rounding (~a row) are
