/// ALONE therefore refused pairs on which an admissible paying shrink exists,

/// `t ≤ 0.25` is admissible and pays 0.0019–0.0033 while the frontier reads
/// a gain of −0.012, so the pair was refused although the path held a rescue

/// closes that, and the sweep is also what makes the gain bar sound: the bar
/// is now applied to the MAXIMUM over the admissible set, so a `None` really
/// does mean "nothing on this path pays".
///
/// PHASE 3 refines the winning cell by golden section, [`PROJECT_REFINE`]

/// both phases is re-judged by all four gates from scratch and only an
/// admissible probe can win, so neither the sweep nor the refinement can walk
