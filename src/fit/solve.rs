    // heuristic (mean-chroma chase) rather than by a validated residual, and
    // it cannot be judged mid-pipeline (see the stage-3 note), so when the
    // finished recipe regresses, halve saturation — refitting the cast curves
    // each step, they depend on the saturated state — until the end-to-end
    // error stops objecting. Saturation is the only shrinkable dial here: if
    // the regression persists at zero, it is reported honestly through
    // err_after/confidence rather than hidden. NOTE the case that motivated
    // this loop (golden-sky pair: a distorted tone map made the whole fit
    // regress) was root-fixed by `tone_cdf_pair`, but the claim that stood
    // here until 2026-09-02 — "no current fixture reaches the loop body" — is
    // FALSE and was measured false. Instrumenting the body and running the
    // whole library battery on this tree (2026-09-02, with the calibration
    // corpus present) logs 186 entries: 107 on the error arm, 140 on the
    // hue-guard arm, 62 on both.
    //
    // So the rescue at the `fit_cast_stage` call below is NOT dead code — it
    // is entered with a conviction to answer: 9 of those 186 re-fits hand
    // back a FAN-CONVICTED cast. What no fixture reaches is the rescue
    // SUCCEEDING here, and the measurement says why. All 9 are ALSO
    // rotation-blocked, so `earns_projection` returns `None` on every one of
    // them and the projection is never even attempted — 0 of the 186
    // earn it, 0 come back projected. The coupling belongs to the
    // stepped-down states rather than to the gates: at the stage's own call
    // site the same battery separates them on 67 of 545 stage runs (the
    // census in `a_silently_rejected_colour_stage_now_says_so`).
    //
    // That is a measured dead end, not a postponement. About forty pairs were
    // built for it — one-sided-band wedges to drive the hue-guard arm,
    // split-chroma frames to drive the error arm — and every one reproduced
    // the coupling. The projection arithmetic is pinned where it lives, at
    // `search_cast_projection`
