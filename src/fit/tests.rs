///     warm LEFT this band in v1.2.3 (CAST-2): its fan-convicted cast is
///     projected instead of thrown away, the reset no longer fires, and
///     it lands at 0.0437 — asserted below where it now is rather than

///     and canyon gold 0.093 … 0.093 is the tightest constraint, 8% of

///     re-measurement, and 0.093 sits BELOW JOINT_FAR_ERR, so a refusal
///     reading it would have emitted no refusal note at all.

/// v1.2.4 B1 — what the fan gate costs on a REAL two-temperature scene,

/// v1.2.3 shipped the gate with its cost measured only on synthetic
/// two-temperature frames (`two_temperature_coast`), and said so: on a
/// real photograph lit at two colour temperatures at once the gate could
/// in principle refuse a cast the photograph genuinely needs. Two such
/// photographs were then found in the user's own library by searching
/// 169 per-exemplar descriptions for mixed lighting and looking at the
/// finished renders: `p40`, a night street under neon and shop signs
/// beneath a fiery sunset sky, and `p41`, a building at twilight with a
/// warm horizon band, a deep blue sky and a warm lamp.
///
/// The measured answer (2026-09-02, both pairs at the shipped default)
/// is that the gate costs these pairs NOTHING, and the margin is the
/// interesting part: `p40`'s fitted cast reads 13.5° of added fan against
/// the 15° line — 1.5° of headroom, the closest any real pair in the
/// corpus comes — and ships ADMITTED as fitted, 0.0788 → 0.0335 at
/// confidence 0.612. `p41`'s reads 9.0°, and its cast is refused by a
/// different gate entirely (the pixel-aligned re-hue veto), so the fan
/// gate is not what withheld it there either.
///
/// WHICH fan this test reads, since 2026-09-21. Until then it read a
/// candidate it rebuilt itself (`cast_stage_candidate_from`), whose
/// channel curves come from the UNWEIGHTED [`residual_channel_curve`]
/// while the solve derives its own over the evidence × robust-pairing
/// weights. The two have never been one candidate on a real pair — the
/// rebuild read 13.5° where the gate itself read 11.0° — and a 2–3° proxy
/// gap is not a rounding error on a 15° line. The subject here is the
/// GATE'S verdict, so the pin is the gate's own reading, the one it
/// publishes in [`keys::FIT_NOTE_CAST_ADMITTED_FAN`] and the photographer
/// reads in the rationale.
///
/// Re-measured 2026-09-21, twice, because two fixes moved the frame this
/// solve reads: the calibration's base look began to be estimated against
/// the picture the camera drew (`render::camera_base_look` — the lens
/// profile's corner lift no longer enters the CDF match on a body whose
/// preview does not show it), and then the develop window moved onto the
/// DefaultCrop rectangle for a RAW that declares no active area
/// (`decode::aligned_demosaic_roi`), which puts every render of this body
/// on Lightroom's own frame instead of 32 px right and 20 px down of it.
///
/// The question this test asks keeps its answer, and on a shared frame it
/// is answered for one more pair than before. `p40` is unmoved: 11.0° of
/// added fan before the origin fix and 11.9° after, against the 15° line,
/// admitted both times, 0.0742 → 0.0338 at confidence 0.601. `p41` is
/// what moved: its cast used to be withheld — by neither the fan gate nor
/// the projection, both measured absent, and the 2026-09-02 record above
/// names the pixel-aligned re-hue veto — and on the shared frame it is
/// ADMITTED at 9.0°, its fit going 0.0745 → 0.0188 at confidence 0.498
/// where the same pair gave 0.0714 → 0.0581 at 0.370 one frame earlier.
/// The six corpus pairs' residuals moved both ways under the two fixes;
/// the ledger's Part 13 carries the table. The figures of 2026-09-02 stay
/// as the record of what the gate was shipped on.
///
/// Re-measured 2026-09-23 for the third calibration era: the base look
/// is now matched on 64-column block means of the two pictures
/// (`render::camera_base_knots`), not on their pixel distributions, so
/// the neutral frame this solve starts from carries a different curve on
/// both pairs. The question keeps its answer on both. `p40` is admitted
/// at 12.1° (11.9° before), its fit 0.0676 → 0.0319 (0.0742 → 0.0338)
/// at confidence 0.605 (0.601); `p41` is admitted at 10.3° (9.0°), its
/// fit 0.0802 → 0.0253 (0.0745 → 0.0188) at 0.496 (0.498). Both fans
/// stay under the 15° line by the margin the mutation below measures.
