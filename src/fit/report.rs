/// is exactly the kind of stale claim this round is about. Deterministic and
/// local — the same two renders the fit already pays for.
///
/// This REPLACED a numbers-only `rescore` returning `(err, confidence)`
/// (R23 review MED-3). That signature was the defect's enabler: it re-measured
/// honestly and left the caller holding a report whose notes it had to source
/// somewhere, and both call sites sourced them by `notes.clone()`. Every
/// outcome sentence in that clone then described the recipe BEFORE the move —
/// the joint numbers, the far-from-target verdict, the unrepresented-controls
/// diagnosis, and a `FIT_NOTE_SAT_REDUCED` quoting a saturation the recipe no
/// longer had. Worst of all it carried `FIT_NOTE_REGRESSED`, on which the GUI
/// raises 「THE REVERSE-FIT WAS DISCARDED — reset to neutral」: after a terminal
/// reset the deep arm can adopt base ± 10, and the user was told nothing had
/// been applied while ± 10 was persisted.
///
/// `prior` is the solved report's notes, and three families cross over — all
/// statements about the SOLVE that the adjustment cannot falsify:
///   * `FIT_NOTE_SAT_PEGGED` — the chroma chase hit the ±60 model cap, a fact
///     about the target's chroma being out of the model's reach;
///   * `FIT_NOTE_REHUE_BLOCKED` / `FIT_NOTE_CAST_REJECTED` — which gate refused
///     the colour stage, and the adjustment does not refit those curves.
///   * `FIT_NOTE_VOUCHED_CONVERGENCE` — which one-sided bands the paired solve
///     individually vouched; adjusting the recipe does not rerun that solve.
///
/// The three that are deliberately DROPPED rather than re-derived, because they
/// report an action the solver took on a recipe this report no longer describes:
/// `FIT_NOTE_REGRESSED`, `FIT_NOTE_JOINT_REGRESSED` (the terminal reset — the
/// adjusted recipe is not the neutral one that note is about, and re-running the
/// harm test here would either lie the same way or silently overrule the
/// caller's own adoption decision), and `FIT_NOTE_SAT_REDUCED` (the do-no-harm
/// loop's pull-back, whose "from X to Y" pair the adjustment breaks — and whose
/// attribution to that loop would be false once the deep step moved the dial
/// again). The caller states what it did through `FIT_NOTE_DEEP_ADOPTED`
/// instead, which is the honest owner of that sentence.
///
/// In Full mode `err_before` is the caller's, unchanged by construction. An
/// Atmosphere rescore rebuilds the same structure-blind ruler as the solve and
/// re-measures the untouched base on it, so the report cannot mix rulers.
/// `base` is the recipe the SOLVE started from — the caller's composed
/// calibration base (`pipeline::calibration_recipe`) on a photograph, the
/// default on a fixture — and the evidence model, the divergence reading and
/// the veto disclosures are all measured against ITS develop. Until
/// 2026-09-24 this function developed a bare default instead, so on every
/// photo whose calibration was not neutral (which, since v1.6.0's estimated
/// base look, is every photo) the rescored Atmosphere evidence model was not
/// the solve's, and `calibration_atmosphere_rescore_reproduces_report_ruler`
