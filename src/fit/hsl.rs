/// no pixel pairing, only the claim that both frames' members of that band
/// are measurements of the same subject. That claim is exactly what the
/// evidence model already adjudicates — so this stage asks it, and asks it
/// with the SAME criterion the unrepresented-controls disclosure reads
/// (`evidence.hue[band].weight > 0` plus a two-sided [`EVIDENCE_MIN_SHARE`]
/// of the chromatic mass). One gate, two consumers; a band either side cannot
/// see is left at zero and NAMED, never silently read as "equal".
///
/// `hsl.hue` is never written. Rotating a band re-populates it, so its own
/// evidence is circular (project memory: "the hue evidence is circular"), and
/// it is the axis that turned brown rock olive in the 2026-07-07 failure.
///
/// The chase is closed-loop through the real engine for the same reason the
/// global chroma chase is: `apply_hsl` runs before saturation, the wheels and
/// clarity, blends two bands per pixel through a partition of unity and fades
/// itself out below chroma 0.22 — so the open-loop ratio is a first step, not
/// an answer. Two iterations, then a do-no-harm that shrinks to zero.
